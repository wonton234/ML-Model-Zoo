All code was first run on google collab and then moved to vscode and then Github


Step by step to run the code:

Start by running the Dataset Overview. This will download the data, put it into the data folder, and transform the the train/ test data into feature vectors for Naive Bayes, MLP and Decision Trees

Each Folder inside of Models has 4 different files. 

-The "folder_name".py file is the code to train the Models
-The .pkl or .pth file is the saved model that can be used for evaluation
-The Evaluation.py is the code that lets you rerun the model in evaluation mode and reprint the results
-The Confusion matrix is the image variation of the confusion matrix printed in the evaluation



The confusion matrix produced by the Decision tree is just an example since all the confusion matrices produced are near perfect and there isnt any reason in isolating the 
specific testset used to produce the results


The VGG evaluation models (.pth files) are available on GitHub since they were too big to add to the moodle submission.
